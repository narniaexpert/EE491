<h1>Game Scores File Overview</h1>
<p>The GameScores file is essential for communication between the Game Control Panel and the rest of the system. The Game Server will record information about each successful hit in the GameScores file so that the Game Control Panel may read this information and update the scores. The Game Control Panel will start and stop the gameplay by writing keywords to the GameScores file that will be read by the Game Server and sent to the laser guns. When the game begins a formatted header will be added to the text file displaying the game settings. When the game is reset, the final game scores will be appended to the end of the file and the GameScores file will be moved to an archives folder and given a new name.</p>
