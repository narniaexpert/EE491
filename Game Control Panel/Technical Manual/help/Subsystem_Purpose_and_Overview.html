<h1>Subsystem Purpose and Overview</h1>
<p>This is a subsystem application that will run on the Robotag server. The Game Control Panel does not communicate directly with the robots or guns. The robot will communicate with the guns through 802.12 wireless communications. The robot will keep a log of who was shot and who they were shot by based on the information the robot receives from the guns. This information is relayed to the Game Server by the robot and appended into the game scores text file. This application will send a signal through the Game Server to the laser gun subsystem to start, resume, or end a game. The Game Control Panel will read confirmed hit data from the text file and display game scores. When the game is reset the Game Control Panel will append the score results to the end of the file and move the file to an archived games folder. </p>
